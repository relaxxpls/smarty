The Better Team (TBT) wlcomes you to the virtual simulation of Smarty!

You can also view the cameras by starting the rqt GUI!
	Procedure:
	For example with the camera view, the easiest way is to start the rqt GUI (by entering "rqt" into a terminal) then from  		the menu select Plugins->Visualization->Image View. Then select your camera feed from the pull down menu and you should 		see the video stream (you can also view this information from inside RViz, but I find this way to be more intuitive). 

Rviz Method:
launch for rviz(inorder to view the cameras)
roslaunch smartytbt load_urdf_into_rviz.launch
